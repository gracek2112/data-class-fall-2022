This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

bmore_absent_info  <- read_csv("hs_absent_bmore.csv")
clean_names(bmore_absent_info)

```



```{r}
most_absents_2019 <-bmore_absent_info %>% 
  select(CSA2010, abshs19) %>% 
  #group_by(album_name) %>% 
  arrange(desc(abshs19))%>% 
  head(10)


```
