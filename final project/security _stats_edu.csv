"\1\Security staff include security guards, security personnel, School Resource Officers (SROs), and sworn law enforcement officers who are not SROs. ""Security guards"" and ""security personnel"" do not include law enforcement. SROs include all career law enforcement officers with arrest authority who have specialized training and are assigned to work in collaboration with school organizations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"\2\Prior to 2015-16, the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) questionnaire asked respondents whether any of the security guards, security personnel, or sworn law enforcement officers at their school routinely carried a firearm. In 2015-16 and 2017-18, the SSOCS questionnaire asked respondents only whether any of the sworn law enforcement officers (including SROs) at their school routinely carried a firearm; therefore, direct comparisons with earlier years should be avoided. Data on security staff routinely carrying a firearm were not collected in the 2013-14 Fast Response Survey System (FRSS).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"\3\Data for 2013-14 were collected using the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS), while data for all other years were collected using the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS). The 2013-14 FRSS survey was designed to allow comparisons with SSOCS data. However, all respondents to the 2013-14 survey could choose either to complete the survey on paper (and mail it back) or to complete the survey online, whereas all respondents to SSOCS had only the option of completing a paper survey prior to 2017-18, when SSOCS experimented with offering an online option to some respondents. The 2013-14 FRSS survey also relied on a smaller sample than SSOCS. The FRSS survey's smaller sample size and difference in survey administration may have impacted the 2013-14 results.

"\4\Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8. Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9. Combined schools include all other combinations of grades, including K–12 schools. Separate data on high schools and combined schools are not available for 2013–14.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
